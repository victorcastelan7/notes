# Notes

This folder contains my personal Solidity learning notes and reflections.  
It is organized into subfolders for clarity:

- **summaries/** → weekly progress recaps (e.g., `week1.md`)
- **daily/** → day-to-day logs, thoughts, and quick notes
- **snippets/** → code snippets, references, and small experiments

---

These notes track my journey through Solidity fundamentals and beyond,  
serving both as a personal journal and a public record of progress.
